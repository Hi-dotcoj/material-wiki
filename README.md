Chrome extension that adds Material Design presentation when viewing pages on Wikipedia

This is a WIP effort to improve the experience of reading Wikipedia pages.

It's not yet complete and I simply can't find the time to keep working on it, so I've decided to make it MIT so that others may continue the work.

To try it out, go to Chrome -> Tools -> Extensions, enable Developer Mode and load the unpacked extension.

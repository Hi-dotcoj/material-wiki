This is a WIP effort to improve the experience of reading Wikipedia pages.

It's not yet complete and I simply can't find the time to keep working on it, so I've decided to make it MIT so that others may continue the work.

To try it out, go to **Chrome** -> **Tools** -> **Extensions** and click the **Load Unpacked** button.
